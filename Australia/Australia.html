        <dd class="AttDesc">
            The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef system, composed of over 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands stretching for over 2,300 kilometres (1,400 mi) over an area of approximately 344,400 square kilometres (133,000 sq mi).
            The reef is located in the Coral Sea, off the coast of Queensland, Australia, separated from the coast by a channel 160 kilometres (100 mi) wide in places and over 61 metres (200 ft) deep. 
            The Great Barrier Reef can be seen from outer space and is the world's biggest single structure made by living organisms.

        <dd class="AttDesc">
            Uluru , also known as Ayers Rock  and officially gazetted as Uluru / Ayers Rock,[1] is a large sandstone monolith. 
            It crops out near the centre of Australia in the southern part of the Northern Territory, 335 km (208 mi) south-west of Alice Springs.
            Uluru is sacred to the Pitjantjatjara, the Aboriginal people of the area, known as the Aṉangu. The area around the formation is home to an abundance of springs, waterholes, rock caves and ancient paintings. 
            Uluru is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

        <dt><a class="HypeAtt" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daintree_Rainforest" target="_blank"> Daintree Rainforest</a></dt>
        <dd class="AttDesc">
            The Daintree Rainforest, also known as the Daintree, is a region on the northeastern coast of Queensland, Australia, about 105 km (65 mi), by road, north of the city of Cairns. 
            At around 1,200 square kilometres (460 sq mi),the Daintree is a part of the largest contiguous area of tropical rainforest in Australia, known as the Wet Tropics of Queensland. 
            The region, along with a select number of other rainforest areas on the Australian east coast, collectively form some of the oldest extant rainforest communities in the world. At around 180 million years old, these ancient, self-sustaining forests are nearly 100 million years older than the Amazon of South America (the world’s largest rainforest and top region for biodiversity), and have witnessed dinosaurs, ice ages, and early humans all come and go.
            In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the Daintree Rainforest was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as a "natural attraction".
